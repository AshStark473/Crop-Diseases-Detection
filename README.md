# RiceLeaf-Diseases Detection
A CNN-based model is suggested for identifying rice leaf diseases using digital photographs of leaves.
The model is trained using a large dataset of labeled rice leaf images affected with various diseases. <br>
The model uses fully connected layers to categorize leaves into illness groups and convolutional layers to extract characteristics from input photos.
Using digital photographs for disease detection has several benefits, including non-invasive method and early detection of diseases to minimize yield losses.

DataSet used for this is given below : <br>
